# Command-Line Chatroom
An implementation of a chatroom that runs inside of the terminal. Allows you to chat with multiple users at the same time in a chatroom.

## To-Do (WIP)
- [x] Figure out how to get console output to overwrite itself
- [ ] (?) Create a "Message" class which stores text, user who posted it, timestamp(?), etc.
- [ ] Create a "Chatroom" class to organize a set of connections and messages
- [ ] Set up 3-way handshake for connection validation? (might not be necessary with sockets)
